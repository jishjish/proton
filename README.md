# Proton

Crypto data is ubiquitous, ~free~, and public... yet it is largely unusable if trying to reference at scale. <br>

Building on open source data extraction tools Proton aims to provide highly specialized compression for commonly used crypto datasets (transfers, logs, metadata, etc.). At present, Proton is focused on buiding through Parquet file types.

Proton will evenetually morph to a Rust crate, but for now is in alpha/early development.
<!-- - **Note**: After installation, replace `cargo run` with `terrier`
- **Note**: Supported file types: `Rust`, `Python`, `Javascript`. -->


<!-- ## Quick Commands `cargo run`

- **Grep search for keywords**: `cargo run -- grep -p "src/main.rs" -k searching`
- **Get functions in file**: `cargo run -- func -p "src/main.rs"`
- **Find how functions are interconnected**: `cargo run -- link -p "src/"`
- **Function tree analysis**: `cargo run -- tree -p "src/main.rs"`
